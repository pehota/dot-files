# Dotfiles

These are the configurations that I am using across a couple of operating systems.

## Prerequisites/caveats

- The install script and configs have been tested to work only on the following operating systems
  - MacOS
  - Manjaro
- The install script requires to be run in bash (version >= 5)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to "$HOME_DIR/.dotfiles"
1. Checkout the OS-specific branch that you need
1. In the terminal go to "$HOME_DIR/.dotfiles"
1. From there run the following command:
   ```bash
   sh ./scripts/install.sh
   ```
